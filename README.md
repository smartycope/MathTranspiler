# Math Transpiler
A program that, in addition to being a symbolic solver and (eventually) graphing calculator, also converts math into python code.

# About
Every time I have to do math, I want to convert it to programming. I understand code, and math is basically just programming, but where all the calculations are on the same line, and all the variables are 1 letter, which is TERRIBLE coding practice. So this is a math to python transpiler to de-mystify math for all you programmers out there.

# Installation
It's built on PyQt5.

        pip install --user PyQt5 sympy

then just run...

        python main.py

and it should work!
